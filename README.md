# LocalLLM

LocalLLM is a powerful framework for implementing and utilizing local Large Language Models (LLMs). It is designed to enable users to run and customize their AI models locally without relying on external cloud services. This project is aimed at both AI developers and businesses looking to keep their data secure and private.

## Features

- **Locally executed LLMs**: No need to send data to external servers.
- **Easy integration**: Provides APIs and example scripts for quick implementation.
- **Customizability**: Supports fine-tuning models for specific use cases.
- **Multi-model support**: Compatible with multiple LLM architectures (e.g., GPT, LLaMA).
- **Efficiency optimizations**: Leverages modern techniques to optimize computational resources.

## Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- At least 16 GB of RAM (32 GB recommended)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but recommended for faster inference)

Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `numpy`
- `flask` (if you want to use the API)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rob9999/LocalLLM.git
   cd LocalLLM
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up your GPU environment to optimize performance.

## Usage

### 1. Loading a Model

Use the provided scripts to load a model:

```python
from localllm import ModelLoader

# Example: Loading a GPT model
model = ModelLoader.load_model("gpt-model-path")
output = model.generate("Hello, how can I help you?")
print(output)
```

### 2. Starting an API

You can host a local API to make your models accessible:

```bash
python api_server.py
```

Access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Fine-tuning a Model

An example script for fine-tuning is included in the `scripts/finetuning` directory.

## Examples

Check out the example scripts in the `examples` folder to get started quickly. These include:

- Text generation
- Question-answering systems
- Fine-tuning for domain-specific applications
